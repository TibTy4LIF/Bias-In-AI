    <ul class="positioned">
       <li>
        (Mid 1800s) Ada Lovelace created the first computer program.
       </li>
       <li>
        (1936) Alan Turning published a paper on universal computing machines.
       </li>
       <ol>
        The  Entscheidungsproblem was a problem that Alan Turning was trying to solve in his paper “On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem” - A. M. Turing, 1936. He resolved that this problem was impossible to solve. The problem was introduced by Wilhelm Ackermann and David Hilbert. These people wanted to know if a computer could decide yes or no depending on the given statement and meeting all of the axioms. Alan Turning published this paper not knowing that the problem he was trying to solve was to eliminate bias in artificial intelligence.
       </ol>
       <li>
        (1941) Konrad Zuse built the first programmable computer, the Z3.
       </li>
       <li>
        (1948) The term cybernetics was first used by Norbert Wiener in his book.
       </li>
       <li>
        (1956, August 31 - September 1) The Dartmouth conference and the official birth of AI.
       </li>
       <ol>
        The Dartmouth conference was a conference to enhance the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference sparked new inquiries into AI.
       </ol>
       <li>
        (1958) Frank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron, which is a type of artificial neural network.
       </li>
       <li>
        (1959) Aurthur Samuel created the term “Machine Learning.”
       </li>
       <li>
        (1970) James A. Anderson developed the Backpropagation algorithm.
       </li>
       <li>
        (NOW) Bias in AI.

        Historical Change-makers:

        <li>
            David Hilbert

    </ul>
    <p class="positioned">These historical change-makers in the past were not trying to solve bias in AI because that problem was not seen. These change-makers actually fought for the right for AI to be implemented in life. In the past, even in the late 1900s, it was rare for anyone to even use the types of technology that we use today let alone AI. The historical change-makers listed above played major roles in how people thought technology and AI.</p>
