            Some ways to take action is to spreading awareness inperson (ie Posters, Speaking, etc), Change or make a policy or a law, Spread awareness on social media. In the 1970s a group of staff members found out that the medical school that they were working for was using AI to select students for the school. In the recemnt years the school was becoming less diverse. The staff members took action to take a stance against the algorithm by speaking out to different people about these issues and then reported it to committees and people with power. In their first example with the staff members, they were denied to change the algorithm and the person who created the algorithm said that there was nothing wrong with it. However, later on the two senior lecturers found out about this investigation and decided to report it to a higher committee. This is an example when changemakers can change other people's views.

          AI has just revealed itself as a major step forward in history with AI's such as ChatGPT, GitHub Auto Pilot, and Cohere. Bias in AI has been around for quite some time, however, it has just recently been discovered. New problems have arisen due to AI being implemented in daily life. Ethical dilemmas like if AI should be used in school or in jobs have come about. It is up to us, humans, to shape the future to what we think is right. AI is not going anywhere, and so we can take action by learning how to be responsible with AI's first with ourselves, and once we achieve that, we can spread awareness on different methods on how to live with our partner, AI.
