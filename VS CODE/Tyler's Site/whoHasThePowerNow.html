        According to CNN, In a documentary which is streaming on Netflix, an African American woman named Joy Buolamwini, put a white mask on her face, and then faced her computer, and it immediately registered that there was a face there. However, when she took the mask off, the computer did not recognise anything there. (Lydialyle Gibson)

        “The study's authors, Maggie Delano and Kendra Albert, used Fitbit and the Withings Smart Scale to show how long-held (and often inaccurate) assumptions about gender inform the decision-making in quasi-medical applications.” - Dell

        According to IEEE Spectrum, when some staff members thought that there was not enough diversity in the medical school, they conducted an internal investigation of the algorithm that was scanning the different applications, they found that the algorithm was judging people on the name and where they were born.

            Since AIs rely on having data on people's perspective and information, the people who don't have access to this technology will not have their views recognised. This creates bias towards people who do have access because they are the only ones who data is being collected on.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            Creating and developing AIs and new technology requires significant computing power, data, and resources to create. Only a handful of people and organizations have enough money and power to create these new technologies.

        <dd>
            Only a few of the biggest companies today have control of the technology that we use regularly today. These companies have the power to make decisions that could impact even billions of people today.

            Ethical dilemmas on AI are usually decided by a small group of experts rather than a big group of people.

            The people who have the power in the past were people of coding expertise because they were the only ones who knew how to change or alter code of technology. Now, the government has the power because they are the ones who are able to stop people from changing certain codes or algorithms of AI or technology. In the past these specialists had the power because no one knew how to fix code or change it. However, now the government has the power because they recognized that technology is very powerful and so they wanted to control it. Some people who are fighting for change against AI or technology have no concept of technology at all, some of the change makers are altering the code themselves so that the AI will have very limited bias.

            Order is maintained because the people in the government who monitor the coders may not actually know about AI and how to create one. The coders on the other hand know what to do and how to do it. However, the government keeps the coders in check by limiting them to only creating certain things. This is how the coders and the government keep each other in check. The status quo is maintained because if the government does not have the coders they will not be able to help reduce bias in AI, this gives the coders some status from the government. The government also gets status because they control the coders to only do certain things. In the past people like Alan Turning maintained the status quo by creating new technology and algorithms.

            The people who are experts in writing code have interpersonal power because they are able to create code and are able to take action by altering the code in the AI. They can take action by reducing the amount of bias in AI. Major companies like Amazon have used AI to hire people for their company and that is institutional power. However, now becuase of changemakers, companises like Amazon have stoped using AI to hire people.
